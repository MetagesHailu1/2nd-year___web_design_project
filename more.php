   <b> HISTORY OF ARBAMINCH GENERAL HOSPITAL </b><br><br><br>
His Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie founded Arba Minch Hospital on December 7, 1961, Ethiopian <br>calendar.
 then Governor Dejazmach Aemro Selassie Abebe selected a suitable place for construction of the <br>
hospital to serve the population from the two sub-cities. The Ethiopian Ministry of Health, Angelina <br>
Roberto and Kebede Mulat General Contractors made a contractual agreement to build the hospital.<br>
 The Ministry of Health requested the Norwegian Lutheran Mission (NLM) to manage the hospital after <br>
 the establishment.<br><br>
 Accordingly,the hospital started its work in 1965 with two Medical doctors, three <br>
 Nurses and nine health assistants.The first medical doctor of the hospital was the Icelandic national<br>
  called Dr Johannes Olafsson, who worked in Ethiopia from 1960 to 1980.Arba Minch hospital has introduced the<br>
   first sonography machine in 1977, which was also the first for the country.The machine was introduced by a <br>
   Norwegian medical doctor named Torvid Kiserude, who has worked in Arba Minch hospital for 8 years.<br>
The NLM's role in managing the hospital was over in 1990 when the Ethiopian nationals replaced the foreigners.<br>
 Since then,the focus of the NLM changed to training medical specialists in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, 
 <br>construction of training centres and provision of medical equipment. <br><br>
In 1991 the mission helped in the establishment of intravenous fluid production centre.<br>

Arba Minch General Hospital is the only hospital serving a population of 200,747 people per year in Gamo and other<br> nearby zones.
